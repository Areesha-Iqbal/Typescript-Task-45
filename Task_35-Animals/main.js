// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
var animals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Rabbit"];
//For loop print each animals name
for (var _i = 0, animals_1 = animals; _i < animals_1.length; _i++) {
    var animal = animals_1[_i];
    console.log(animal);
}
//Adding a message for each animals
for (var _a = 0, animals_2 = animals; _a < animals_2.length; _a++) {
    var animal = animals_2[_a];
    console.log("A ".concat(animal, " can be a good pet."));
}
//expressing a general thought about pets
console.log("\nAll of these animals can make great pets with the right care.");
