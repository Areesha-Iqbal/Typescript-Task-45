/// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

//Define a function to create a car object with optional options..
function createCar(manufacturer:string, modelName:string, ...extraOptions:{[key:string]: any}[]):Object{
  const myCar ={
    manufacturer,
    modelName,
    ...Object.assign({}, ...extraOptions)
  }
  return myCar;
}

//Call the function to create a car object
let answer = createCar("Toyota","Corolla",{color:"Black"},{features:["Power window","Sunroof"]});

//Print the car object
console.log(answer);
