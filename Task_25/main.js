// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
var alien_color = "Green";
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
if (alien_color === "Green") {
    console.log("You earned 5 points");
}
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. 
alien_color = "Yellow";
//(The version that fails will have no output.)
if (alien_color === "Green") {
    console.log("You earned 5 points"); //no output
}
