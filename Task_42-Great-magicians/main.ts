// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

//Create a Array
let magicianNames: string[] = ["Dynamo", "Criss Angel", "Teller", "Ricky Jay"];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
  magicians.forEach((name) => console.log(name));
}

//To show names with out great
console.log("Magicians Name:");
show_magicians(magicianNames);

//Modify the function
//function for adding Great in names
function make_great(magicians: string[]) {
  magicians.forEach((name) => console.log(`The Great ${name}`));
}

//Show magician names with "The Great" added
console.log("\nGreat Magicians:");
make_great(magicianNames);
